# Pygame: Hello World

*A simple collection of scripts I made while learning/teaching the Pygame library.*

## Virtual Environment

I always forget how to use Python's venv so here's a simple cheat sheet:

- Create Virtual Environment

  `python -m venv <directory>`

- Activate Environment *(bash)*

  `. .venv/Scripts/activate`

- Install/Update Dependencies

  `pip install -r <requirements path>`

- Deactivate Environment

  `deactivate`

## Assets
